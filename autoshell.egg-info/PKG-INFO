# AutoShell ðŸ‘¨ âš™ ðŸ¤–

_Shell which understands humans_

## Introduction

Autoshell is a natural language interfacable CLI application which adds on to the capabilities of your terminal and can execute commands for your input queries.

## Features

The AutoShell has three modes of functionality:

- **Manual Mode**: In this mode the AutoShell behaves like a regular shell which runs the shell commands entered in it.
- **AI mode**: This mode shows the power of the _AutoShell_. It converts your english queries into executable shell commands which perform the actions specified by you in the query.
- **AI-Chat mode**: You can chat with AI to clarify queries on technical issues and detailed description on technical topics.

### Additional Features:

- **Autocomplete for commands**
- **Maintain command history**
- **Generates command logs and generates the logs in a text file**
- **User management through local database**
